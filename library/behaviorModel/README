# This folder contains the code for the temips tests

# To compile the Adder test, type this command:

  > iverilog -g2005 -Wall -Wno-sensitivity-entire-vector -Wno-sensitivity-entire-array -o lib_mulSingleCyc -I . lib_mulSingleCyc.t.v

  This should generate an executable named "lib_mulSingleCyc".

# To run the compiled executable:

  > ./lib_mulSingleCyc

# To remove the executable:

  > rm lib_mulSingleCyc lib_mulSingleCyc.vcd

  That are the only files that's been generated.
